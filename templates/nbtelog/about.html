                    The National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) is an organ of the Federal Ministry of Education which is charged with the responsibility of regulating Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions in Nigeria. The Board was created by an Act of Parliament (Act No. 9 of 11 January, 1977) as a response to the federal Government of Nigeria realization of the need to develop a critical man-power base to execute the nation's National Development Plans initiated in the 1970s.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title mb-3">Historical Background</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    During the third National Development Plan (1975-1980), government had identified acute shortage of technical manpower as a major constraint towards the execution of the development plan. In response to this, government in 1972 established the then National Science and Technology Development Agency, which later became Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, which set up a Working Committee on Scientific and Technical Manpower and Science Education.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The Committee produced a report on Middle-Level Technical Manpower and their training, which recommended among others, the creation of the National Board for Technical Education to be charged with the implementation of its recommendations. It was against this background that the Federal Government established the NBTE by Act No. 9 of 11 January 1977.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title mb-3">Legislative Framework</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Also, in August 1985 and January 1993 respectively, the Federal Government enacted Act 16 (Education National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Act and Act 9, Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Amendment Act. With these acts, the functions of the Board were created and extended to include accreditation of academic programmes of all Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) institutions.
