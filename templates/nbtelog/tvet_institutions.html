                    The National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) is an organ of the Federal Ministry of Education 
                    charged with the responsibility of regulating Technical and Vocational Education and Training 
                    (TVET) institutions in Nigeria.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    In response to the Federal Government of Nigeria's realization of the need to develop a critical 
                    manpower base to execute the nation's National Development Plans initiated in the 1970s, the 
                    National Board for Technical Education was created by an Act of Parliament (Act No. 9 of 11th 
                    January 1977).
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Also, in August 1985 and January 1993 respectively, the Federal Government enacted Act 16 
                    (Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Act and Act 9, 
                    Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Amendment Act.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    With these acts, the functions of the Board were created and extended to include accreditation of 
                    academic programmes of all Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions as 
                    well as establishment of institution.
