                        SERVICOM is an acronym for Service Compact with All Nigerians. It was established in 2004 as the outcome of a Three-day Special Presidential Retreat on Service Delivery with the President, Ministers, Special Advisers, Presidential Aides and Chief Executives of major Extra-ministerial Departments and Parastatals.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        It is an initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria conceived to promote effective and efficient service delivery in order to manage the performance expectation gap between Government and citizens as well as other members of the public on issues of service delivery.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        It virtually gives the public the right to demand good services as contained in MDAS' Service Charter. One of its goals is to ensure that users understand their rights to public services, the service standards they should expect and how to demand for these services.
