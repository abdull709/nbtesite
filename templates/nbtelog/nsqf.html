                    <p class="mb-4">
                        NSQF formerly called NVQF is a system for the development, classification and recognition of skills, knowledge, 
                        understanding and competencies acquired by individuals, irrespective of where and how the training or skill was acquired. 
                        The system gives a clear statement of what the learner must know or be able to do whether the learning took place in a 
                        classroom, on-the-job, or less formally. The framework indicates the comparability of different qualifications and how one 
                        can progress from one level to another. The framework is the structure within which the National Skills Qualifications 
                        (NSQs) operate.
